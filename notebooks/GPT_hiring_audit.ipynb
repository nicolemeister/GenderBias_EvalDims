Set up and calibrated accelerometers on Hyundai cars to conduct tests to analyze the modes of vibration of the vehicle and the steering column. Manufacturing Engineer Intern\t 05/2017 to 07/2017 Analyzed automation, process parameters, different equipment to shape and control the profile of chips, and manufacturing process of Hot Strip Coil. Re-designed the existing shop floor to improve space utilization, increase material flow, optimize labor, reduce holding costs by 5%, and improve space utilization by 20%. Performed statistical analysis on historical data of the operating parameters to identify significant factors contributing to process deviation and affecting the cold crushing strength of the pellet. Generated Bill of Materials and calculated overall manufacturing cost.
